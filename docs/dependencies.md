This project requires certain software packages to function.  The current list of required tools are:

* Python 2.7.* (OS package or source download)
* Git (OS package)
* python-pip (OS package or install via script)
* openssl (OS package)
* python-openssl (OS package)

The OS packages listed above may be available as source-but most Linux distributions will have the available via their included package managers.
